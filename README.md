# Monthly

A single-page tool for turning a pasted Jira ticket export into a monthly delivery board: a "what shipped this month" report you can review, write up, and share.

Sign-in is required — with an **@BHphoto.com email address** — before the board is shown. See **Cloud sync** below.

Paste ticket rows (tab/comma/pipe-separated, or a raw Jira multi-line export) and it builds:

- **Main board** — items grouped by release, sprint, portfolio, priority, or reporter, with per-item writeups (problem / what shipped / impact to watch) and inline editing of every cell.
- **Dashboard** — priority mix, submitted-by-you split, releases/sprints, team load, and writeup coverage as charts.
- **Updates** — a feed view of every item's writeup plus a free-text monthly summary.
- **Export** — copy a formatted report straight into Confluence (rich HTML, wiki markup, or storage format XHTML), or export Markdown, plain text, CSV, or print/PDF.

Everything runs client-side in one HTML file — no build step, no backend required. Board state lives in memory for the session; use **Save this month** to persist a board to the browser's local storage and reload it later from **Saved months**.

Also has a star-to-save-for-later feature (**Year in review**, for pulling together an end-of-year report) and optional shared team storage — see below.

### Sharing a board with your team

The **Saved months** card has a **Share with your team** section: agree on a code with your teammates (e.g. drop one in Slack), then:

- **Push to team** uploads the current board, your saved months, and your starred items to that code.
- **Pull from team** replaces everything in the browser with whatever was last pushed under that code.

This is a shared code, not a login — anyone who has it can read and overwrite that board, so treat it like a shared link rather than a password.

Shared storage runs on a serverless API route (`api/team.js`) backed by Vercel KV, so it only works on the Vercel deployment, not the static GitHub Pages copy. To enable it on Vercel:

1. In the Vercel dashboard, open this project → **Storage** → **Create Database** → **KV** (or connect an existing one), and link it to the project.
2. Redeploy. Vercel injects `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` automatically — no other config needed.

Without a KV store linked, Push/Pull show a message explaining shared storage isn't set up yet; everything else in the app works exactly the same.

### Cloud sync (Firebase)

The whole app sits behind a sign-in screen (email + password, via Firebase Authentication), restricted to **@BHphoto.com** addresses — enforced both client-side (the form rejects other domains before ever calling Firebase) and by Firestore's own security rules (`firestore.rules`), so it holds even if the client-side check is bypassed. New accounts get a verification email and can't use the app until they click it.

Once signed in, everything that keeps Main board, Dashboard, and Updates populated — the current board itself (rows, period, your name, notes, grouping) — plus your **saved months** and **starred items** also sync to your own Firestore document, so they follow you to any browser or device you sign into. The current board also saves to this browser continuously (a moment after you stop typing/editing), so a reload or reopening the tab never loses it, even without clicking `Save this month`. Signing in for the first time on a browser that already has a cloud copy asks before overwriting what's in that browser, the same way `Pull from team` does.

Signing in lasts 4 hours (tracked from the moment you sign in, independent of activity — reloading the page doesn't reset it), after which you're automatically signed out and shown the login screen again. Right before that happens, whatever's currently on the board — even if you never clicked `Save this month` — is saved into **Saved months** so nothing is lost. A normal reload or new tab in the meantime doesn't ask you to sign in again.

This is entirely separate from the team-code sharing feature above — that's unaffected and still works exactly as described.

To enable this on your own Firebase project:

1. Firebase Console → **Authentication** → **Sign-in method** → enable **Email/Password**.
2. Firebase Console → **Firestore Database** → **Create database**.
3. Paste `firestore.rules`'s contents into the Firestore **Rules** tab and publish.

The Firebase web config is inlined directly in `index.html` (these values are public client identifiers by Firebase's own design — the security rules above are what actually restrict access, not hiding this config).

## Running it

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it locally:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Using it

1. Click **Paste tickets**, fill in the period and your name, and paste rows exported from Jira.
2. Click **Build board** (or **Load sample** to see the shape first).
3. Fill in each item's writeup, add a monthly note, and use **Export** to send the report to Confluence, Markdown, CSV, or print.

## Deploying

The included GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) publishes `index.html` to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. Enable it under the repo's **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
